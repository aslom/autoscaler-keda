# Experimental KEDA support for Knative Event Sources Autoscaling


>Warning: Still under development. Not meant for production deployment.

## Design
To enable KEDA Autoscaling of Knative Event Sources (and other components in the future) there is a separate controller implemented, ie. no hard dependency in Knative.
This contoller is watching for `CustomResourcesDefinitions` resources in the cluster, if there is installed a new CRD which is supported by this controller a new dynamic controller watching these resources is created. 
Currently there is support for **Kafka Source** and **AWS SQS Source**.


## Technical details & limitations
This controller requires k8s.io client version >= 0.18, therefore it is using custom fork of [knative/pkg](https://github.com/zroubalik/pkg/tree/k8s18) and [knative/eventing](https://github.com/zroubalik/eventing/tree/k8s18).

## HOW TO

### Install KEDA v2

It is needed to install KEDA v2, which is using different namespace for it's CRDs (`keda.k8s.io` -> `keda.sh`).

Currently there is development (Alpha) version of KEDA v2, to install it follow instructions on:
https://github.com/kedacore/keda/tree/v2#how-can-i-try-keda-v2-alpha-version


Confirm there are 2 pods running in `keda` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n keda
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
keda-metrics-apiserver-7cf7765dc8-k9lnc   1/1     Running   0          5m2s
keda-operator-55658855fc-rc9rb            1/1     Running   0          5m3s
```

### Install `autoscaler-keda` Controller

```bash
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=...
ko apply -f config/
```

Confirm there is 1 pod running in `autoscaler-keda` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n autoscaler-keda
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
controller-76fb8d6756-5f4vm   1/1     Running   0          21m
```

## Example of Kafka Source autoscaled by KEDA

1. Set up Kafka Cluster, eg. use [Strimzi operator](https://strimzi.io/)

2. Install Knative Serving and Eventing 

3. Install Knative Eventing [Kafka Source](https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/tree/master/kafka/source)

4. Create `KafkaSource` resource, with annotation `autoscaling.knative.dev/class: keda.autoscaling.knative.dev`. There are other KEDA related annotations, see the example:

```yaml
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaSource
metadata:
  name: kafka-source
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    autoscaling.knative.dev/class: keda.autoscaling.knative.dev
    autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "0" 
    autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "5" 
    keda.autoscaling.knative.dev/pollingInterval: "3" 
    keda.autoscaling.knative.dev/cooldownPeriod: "10" 
    keda.autoscaling.knative.dev/kafkaLagThreshold: "2"
spec:
  consumerGroup: knative-group
  bootstrapServers: 
    - my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.openshift-operators:9092 
  topics: 
    - test
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
```

5. Check that `ScaledObject` was created for this `KafkaSource`:

```bash
$ kubectl get scaledobjects
oc get so 
NAME                                      SCALETARGETKIND      SCALETARGETNAME                                                 TRIGGERS   AUTHENTICATION   READY   ACTIVE   AGE
so-f87369e5-c320-4f44-b23a-8c535a523e3a   apps/v1.Deployment   kafkasource-kafka-source-f87369e5-c320-4f44-b23a-8c535a523e3a   kafka                       True    False     6m5s
```
